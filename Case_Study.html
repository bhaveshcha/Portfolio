          <h2>Client and Project</h2>
          <p>
            FluxWear is a team that developed a powerful, flexible
            neuromodulation platform. It can be tailored to treat numerous
            centrally mediated conditions, including stress, anxiety, chronic
            pain, migraines, impaired sleep, and stroke recovery. FluxWear’s
            first product, SHIFT, is the world’s first neuromodulation device
            that helps the user’s body and mind recover from life’s stresses and
            strains in just 25 minutes. SHIFT is FDA-registered,
            patent-protected, and used in health clinics around the United
            States.
          </p>
          <p>
            The story of this invention is profoundly personal and started in
            2017 when FluxWear’s co-founder Nadia was diagnosed with
            Guillain-Barre Syndrome. It led to severe chronic pain manifesting
            throughout her body, so she had to experiment with numerous
            conventional and alternative therapies. Still, nothing was reliably
            effective, accessible, and affordable over the long term. To help
            her, Nadia’s brother, Kamran, another of FluxWear’s co-founders and
            CEO, experimented with various modalities and eventually settled on
            pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF), given the underlying
            clinical studies and for PEMF’s potential portability,
            affordability, and form factor. Starting in 2017, they began the
            arduous process of rethinking PEMF from the ground up. Explaining
            the mission of FluxWear, Kamran Ansari says: “We created SHIFT to
            help solve fundamental challenges in the treatment of pain and
            anxiety, particularly among young people. Parents, counselors,
            nurses, physical therapists, corporate wellness programs, and our
            educational institutions need better tools to help them address the
            mental and physical crises being experienced throughout the US
            today.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The FluxWear team approached us with the request to create a web
            design that would tell the product’s story and uncover its benefits
            to those who need it in an engaging, friendly, and informative way.
            So, we designed the website for them and implemented it with
            Webflow.
          </p>
          <p>
            The creative team from the tubik side included Diana Krupa,
            Vladyslav Taran, Roma Chornyi, Natalka Mamchur, and Nick Zhuravlov.

          <h2>Web Design Refreshment</h2>
          <p>
            The FluxWear team approached us well-prepared, with a deep
            understanding of what they wanted to show and achieve with the
            website. During the research and discussion stages, the creative
            team, in close collaboration with the client, developed a clear
            vision and recommendations on what content should be provided for
            that goal. The various types of content that would be integrated
            into the website involved different kinds of demonstrations and
            engagement. Photos and videos unveiled the product and showed it in
            use. Together with text, they added deep human and emotional
            elements to the user experience, featuring the founders telling the
            story of product creation. Also, like many innovative and
            experimental products, this one demanded a lot of textual content to
            make the presentation informative and explanatory for potential
            users. So, the primary goal was to organize all the mentioned
            thoughtfully and attractively to make the user experience design
            positive and engaging.

            Here’s a glance at the early stage of the creative process, UX
            wireframing, when the designers considered the effective website
            structure, page structure, functional navigation, and compelling
            content arrangement.

            Let’s check how all these solutions worked in actual web design.
            Here’s the home page that captures visitors’ attention from the
            first seconds with the prominent demonstration of the actual product
            in the hero section and a short, concise textual explanation of the
            problem it solves. Primary navigation and the CTA button inviting
            visitors to purchase are easily accessible on the neat sticky
            website header. The switch button under the SHIFT device’s image
            allows instant checking of what it looks like in two different
            colors.
